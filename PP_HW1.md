#### Assignment 1 -- due Oct 7th -- please send it to daschapopowa@gmail.com

1. Choose a long text (a novel), do preprocessing on it (delete punctuation, lemmatize it) -- 2 points
2. Train a word2vec model on the chosen text, set the parameters (window size, vector size, number of iterations etc.), comment on your choice of parameter settings and the reasoning behind it -- 3 points (1 point for the model, 2 points for the comments)
3. Test your model, use `most_similar`, `similarity`, `doesnt_match` functions, comment on the model performance -- 3 points (1 point for the use of the functions, 2 points for the comments and reasoning behind the testing)
4. Visualize the results of the training and testing (one plot or one graph), comment on the visualization -- 2 points (1 point for the plot/graph, 1 point for the commentary)

You can work on this assignment in pairs, if you choose to do so, create two models with different parameter settings, compare the results (which model was more successful and why?) and two visualizations (two plots or two graphs or a plot and a graph)
